terminal information fetchers

Borrowed some code and a little inspiration from ufetch, neofetch, and screenfetch for these superfast info fetchers.

These are meant to be distro specific... Mainly to keep them fast.

I have only made ones for debian and arch... If you want to take one and make it for your distro of choice... 

Go ahead and use it as you like. 

Dependencies

It should not depend on anything you don't already have installed.

maybe mesa-utils if you are using glxinfo to call your GPU model.


NOTE:  Debian and Devuan fetchers have been updated recently, no so much on the others...
